## 👨🏽‍💻 ABOUT ME 

Hi there 👋🏽 
I’m James Quarshie. I am a **data analyst and research professional** with hands-on experience across the full data lifecycle — from **survey design** and **digital data collection** to **statistical analysis** and **insight generation**. My work sits at the intersection of **research**, **business intelligence**, and **development practice**, where evidence is used to inform decisions, shape policy, and improve outcomes.

I have worked extensively with field survey platforms such as **Survey Solutions**, **SurveyCTO**, and **Kobo Collect**, and I am comfortable managing data from complex surveys through to clean, analysis-ready datasets. On the data managment, cleaning, and analytics side, I use **STATA**, **Python**, **SPSS**, **SQL**, and **Excel** to explore data, test hypotheses, and communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Beyond tools, I care about data quality, methodological rigor, and practical relevance. I enjoy translating raw data into insights that are actionable, defensible, and grounded in real-world contexts — particularly within research, monitoring & evaluation, and development-focused projects.

## 📂 FEATURED PROJECTS

| Thumbnail | Project Title | Description | Repository |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| <img src="data-management.png" alt="GSPS Project" width="300"> | **Data Management \| Ghana Socio-economic Panel Survey** | The GSPS is a major panel data implemented by the Global Poverty Research Lab at the Northwestern University (USA) and the Institute of Statistical Social and Economic Research (Ghana). For this project, I performed data management tasks, including data coding and full harmonization of 1000s of variables across the four major waves of the project. The project was implemented using `STATA`. | [GitHub](https://github.com/jkquarshie/gsps-data-management) |
| <img src="fin.png" alt="Financial Inclusion Project" width="300"> | **The Impact of Governance Quality on Financial Inclusion** | An econometric analysis of the relationship between financial inclusion, governance quality, and economic growth in Ghana using World Bank data (2002–2021). The study applied VAR and VECM models in `STATA` and found that financial inclusion directly supports economic growth, while governance quality does not significantly moderate this effect. | [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/fin-gov) |
| <img src="gpsdf.png" alt="GPSDF Project" width="300"> | **Ghana Private Sector Development Facility (PSDF) Evaluation Project** | The Ghana Private Sector Development Facility (GPSDF) was a multi-phase private sector development initiative aimed at strengthening the capacity competitiveness and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana. The assignment involved the evaluation of Phases I and II of the GPSDF, using survey-based evidence and program data to assess performance, implementation effectiveness, and outcomes. | [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/gpsdf-evaluation) |
